This project is the attempted implementation of the enhanced version of our server-to-client hangman game.

To use the application, you must open at least two separate instances of Bluej, followed by these steps:

1. Run KKMultiServer on one Bluej instance, providing a port number for the command line argument.

2. Run IMClient on the other Bluej instances, with the command line arguments in this order: ("localhost", (port number), (players name))

3. Follow the in-game instructions to play hangman.


Status:
It took us a considerable amount of time to implement the multiserver version of hangman, due to issues relating to the game logic. Once we finished transforming the hangman game to a multiserver scale, we wasted no time in attempting to create a leaderboard that is to be displayed at the end of every game showing the wins of each player. After numerous attempts at trying to implement this, we were able to reach our task of creating a leaderboard that keeps track of the wins of all the clients. If given more time to complete this project, our complete focus would shift to expanding the games word library and word selection process.
